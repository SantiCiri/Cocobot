# Automated Asset Trading on Cocos

This repository is built upon [pyCocos](https://github.com/nacho-herrera/pyCocos).  
It includes a set of Python scripts designed to automatically trade Argentine bonds using the **Cocos Capital** API, and retrieve reference prices from **PPI**.  
The system operates by monitoring prices, detecting arbitrage opportunities, and executing buy/sell orders in real time.

- Supports per-script logging to separate files.
- Emits sound alerts when opportunities are detected.
- Automatically executes trades when an arbitrage opportunity arises.
- Can be integrated with the Windscribe API for IP rotation or remote access.
